# Home Price Insights: A Data Story

## Introduction

In this project, we analyze how various factors influence house prices in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA. By leveraging statistical methods and data visualization techniques, we aim to uncover relationships between housing features (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, location) and their impact on pricing. 

The dataset provides insights into:
- The range of house prices, sizes, and amenities.
- The distribution of properties with features like pools, fireplaces, and waterfront views.
- Temporal trends such as "Days on Market" (DOM).

This analysis is valuable for real estate stakeholders, including buyers, sellers, and policymakers, as it highlights key drivers of housing market dynamics.

## Features

This project includes the following features:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing key variables such as price, square footage, bedrooms, and amenities.
- **Visualization**: Interactive plots and charts to explore data distributions and relationships.
  - Histograms for price and square footage distributions.
  - Scatter plots for price vs. square footage.
  - Boxplots for price by architectural style and waterfront status.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examining relationships between variables like square footage, age, and price.
- **Probability and Hypothesis Testing**: Calculating probabilities and testing hypotheses about features like pools and waterfront properties.
- **Regression Analysis**: Simple and multiple linear regression models to predict house prices.

## Analysis Highlights

### Key Findings
1. **Price Distribution**: House prices range from $22,000 to $1,580,000, with an average of approximately $156,519.
2. **Square Footage**: Most houses fall within the 1,000â€“3,000 sqft range, with an average of 2,373 sqft.
3. **Waterfront Premium**: Waterfront properties command significantly higher prices, with a median of $300,000 compared to $200,000 for non-waterfront homes.
4. **Feature Correlations**: Houses with pools are more likely to have fireplaces (conditional probability of ~72.6%).
5. **Regression Insights**: Square footage is a strong predictor of house prices, explaining ~61% of price variability.

### Visualizations
- **Histograms**: Distribution of house prices and square footage.
- **Scatter Plot**: Relationship between price and square footage.
- **Boxplots**: Price distributions by architectural style and waterfront status.
- **Q-Q Plot**: Residual normality checks for regression models.
